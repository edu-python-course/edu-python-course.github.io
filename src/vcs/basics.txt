Getting a Git repository
========================

You typically obtain a Git repository in one of two ways:

#.  You can take a local directory that is currently not under version control,
    and turn it into a Git repository.
#.  You can clone an existing Git repository from elsewhere.

In either case, you end up with a Git repository on your local machine,
ready for work.

Initializing repo in an existing directory
------------------------------------------

If you have a project directory that is currently not under version control and
you want to start controlling it with Git, you first need to go to that
project's directory. If you've never done this, it looks a little different
depending on which system you're running:

.. code-block:: shell
    :caption: Change directory in bash (Linux)

    cd /home/user/project

.. code-block:: shell
    :caption: Change directory in bash (MacOS)

    cd /Users/user/project

.. code-block:: powershell
    :caption: Change directory in PowerShell (Windows)

    cd C:\Users\user\project

In the project's directory initialize a new Git repository.

.. code-block:: shell

    git init

This creates a new subdirectory named .git that contains all of your necessary
repository files -- a Git repository skeleton.

Cloning an existing repo
------------------------

If you want to get a copy of an existing Git repository -- for example,
a project you'd like to contribute to -- the command you need is ``git clone``.

.. code-block:: shell

    git clone https://github.com/edu-python-course/edu-python-course.github.io

That creates a directory named *edu-python-course.github.io*, initializes a
*.git* directory inside it, pulls down all the data for that repository,
and checks out a working copy of the latest version.

.. code-block:: shell

    git clone https://github.com/edu-python-course/edu-python-course.github.io python-course

That command does the same thing as the previous one, but the target directory
is called *python-course*.

Git has a number of different transfer protocols you can use. The previous
example uses the ``https://`` protocol, but you may also see ``git://`` or
``user@server:path/to/repo.git``, which uses the SSH transfer protocol.
