*******************************************************************************

Pull request let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in
a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and
review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits
before your changes are merged into the base branch:cite:`github:about-pr`.

Draft pull requests
-------------------

Draft pull requests are available in public repositories on GitHub.
When you create a pull request, you can choose to a create a pull request that
is ready for review or a draft pull request. Draft pull requests cannot be
merged. When you're ready to get feedback on your pull request, you can mark
your draft pull request as ready for review.

Difference between commits on compare and pull request pages
------------------------------------------------------------

The compare and pull request pages use different methods to calculate the diff
for changed files:

-   Compare pages show the diff between the tip of the head ref and the current
    common ancestor (that is, the merge base) of the head and base ref.
-   Pull request pages show the diff between the tip of the head ref and
    the common ancestor of the head and base ref at the time when the pull
    request was created.
    Consequently, the merge base used for the comparison might be different.

About comparing branches
========================

Pull requests display diffs to compare the changes you made in your topic
branch against the base branch that you want to merge your changes into.

Rather that viewing the commits themselves, you can view the proposed changes
as they'll appear in the files once the pull request is merged. The files
appear in alphabetical order within the Files changed tab. Additions to
the files appear in green and are prefaced by a ``+`` sign while content that
has been removed appears in red and is prefaced by a ``-`` sign
:cite:`github:compare-pr`.

Creating a pull request
=======================

Create a pull request to propose and collaborate on changes to a repository.
These changes are proposed in a *branch*, which ensures that the default
branch only contains finished and approved work:cite:`github:create-pr`.

About branches
--------------

Use a branch to isolate development work without affecting other branches in
the repository. Each repository has one default branch, and can have multiple
other branches. You can merge a branch into another branch using a pull
request.

Branches allow you to develop features, fix bugs, or safely experiment with
new ideas in a contained area of your repository.

You always create a branch from an existing branch. Typically, you might create
a new branch from the default branch of your repository.
