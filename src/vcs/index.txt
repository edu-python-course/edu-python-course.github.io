###############################################################################

:abbr:`VCS (Version Control Systems)` play an integral role in modern software
development. They allow multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously
without overwriting each other's changes. VCSs track the history of changes
to the source code, making it possible to revert to previous states, compare
versions, and more.

Among the VCSs available, Git stands out as one of the most popular and
powerful tools. It's used by small projects and large-scale software alike,
owing to its flexibility, distributed nature, and efficient handling of
codebase versions.

In this part, you'll learn about the fundamentals of version control, how to
set up your environment for Git, dive into the basics of commits, branches, and
merges, understand the significance of tags, and finally, explore how to
collaborate using remote repositories and platforms like GitHub.
