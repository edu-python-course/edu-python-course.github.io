*******************************************************************************

Now that you have Git on your system, you’ll want to do a few things to
customize your Git environment. Git comes with a tool called ``git config``
that lets you get and set configuration variables that control all aspects of
how Git looks and operates. These variables can be stored in three different
places:

#.  *[path]/etc/gitconfig* file: Contains values applied to every user on
    the system and all their repositories. If you pass the option ``--system``
    to git config, it reads and writes from this file specifically.
    Because this is a system configuration file, you would need administrative
    or superuser privilege to make changes to it.
#.  *~/.gitconfig* or *~/.config/git/config* file: Values specific personally
    to you, the user. You can make Git read and write to this file specifically
    by passing the ``--global`` option, and this affects all of
    the repositories you work with on your system.
#.  *config* file in the Git directory (that is, *.git/config*) of whatever
    repository you’re currently using: Specific to that single repository.
    You can force Git to read from and write to this file with the ``--local``
    option, but that is in fact the default. Unsurprisingly, you need to be
    located somewhere in a Git repository for this option to work properly.

Each level overrides values in the previous level, so values in *.git/config*
trump those in *[path]/etc/gitconfig*.

You can view all of your settings and where they are coming from using:

.. code-block:: shell

    git config --list --show-origin

Your identity
=============

The first thing you should do when you install Git is to set your user name
and email address. This is important because every Git commit uses this
information.

.. code-block:: shell

    git config --global user.name "John Doe"
    git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com

.. todo:
    Add SSH setup
