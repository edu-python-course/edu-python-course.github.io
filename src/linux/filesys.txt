                        File system and file management
*******************************************************************************

A simple description of the UNIX system, also applicable to Linux, is this:

    "On a UNIX system, everything is a file; if something is not a file,
    it is a process"

This statement is true because there are special files that are more that just
files (named pipes and sockets for instance), but to keep things simple, saying
that everything is a file is an acceptable generalization. A Linux system, just
like UNIX, makes no difference between a file and a directory, since
a directory is just a file containing names of other files. Programs, services,
texts, images, and so forth, are all files. Input and output devices, and
generally all devices, are considered to be files, according to the system.

.. rubric:: Sorts of files

:regular files:
    most files are just *files*, called *regular* files; they contain normal
    data, for example text files, executable files or programs, input or
    output from a program and so on.

:directories:
    files that are lists of other files.

:special files:
    the mechanism used for input and output.
    Most special files are in ``/dev``.

:links:
    a system to make a file or directory visible in multiple parts of
    the system's file tree.

:sockets:
    a special file type, similar to TCP/IP sockets, providing inter-process
    networking protected by the file system's access control.

:named pipes:
    act more or less like sockets and form a way for processes to communicate
    with each other, without using network socket semantic.
