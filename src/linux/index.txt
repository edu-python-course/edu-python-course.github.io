Linux is a powerful, open-source operating system widely used in various
domains, from embedded systems to supercomputers. It is known for its
stability, security, and flexibility, making it a preferred choice for
developers, especially in server environments.

.. rubric:: What is an Operating System?

.. _os_overview:

An operating system (OS) is the primary software that manages all the hardware
and other software on a computer.
It acts as an intermediary between the physical hardware and the user
applications, providing essential services needed for the applications
to execute.

.. _os_functions:

The operating system is the fundamental suite of software on a device that
keeps everything together. It interacts with the device's hardware components,
handling everything from input devices like keyboards and mice to output
devices like displays and printers. The OS sits between the applications you
run and the hardware, using hardware drivers as an interface between them.
For instance, when an application wants to print a document, it hands off
the task to the OS. The OS then sends instructions to the printer using printer
drivers to send the correct signals. The printing application does not need
to understand the specifics of the printer or how it works.
The OS handles the details.

OS includes a variety of software components such as system services,
libraries, and :abbr:`APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)` that
developers use to write applications that run on the OS.

The OS also manages multitasking, allocating hardware resources among multiple
running programs. It controls which processes are running, distributing them
among various CPUs if you have a computer with multiple processors or cores,
allowing multiple processes to run in parallel. It also manages the system's
internal memory, allocating memory among running applications.

When we say "computers" run operating systems, we don't just mean traditional
desktop PCs and laptops. Your smartphone is a computer, as are tablets,
smart TVs, gaming consoles, smartwatches, and Wi-Fi routers. An Amazon Echo or
Google Home is a computer device running under the management of an operating
system.

Familiar desktop operating systems include Microsoft Windows, Apple MacOS,
Google's Chrome OS, and Linux. The primary operating systems for smartphones
are Apple's iOS and Google's Android.

Other devices, like a Wi-Fi router, may run "embedded operating systems".
These are specialized operating systems with fewer features than a typical
operating system, designed specifically for a single task - like operating
a Wi-Fi router, navigating, or controlling an ATM.

Operating systems also include other software, including the user interface,
which allows people to interact with the device. This could be the desktop on
a PC, the touch interface on a phone, or the voice interface on a digital
assistant.

The operating system is a large piece of software made up of many different
applications and processes. The line between what is the operating system and
what is a program can sometimes be a bit blurred.
There isn't a strict official definition of an operating system.

For instance, in Windows, the File Explorer application is an integral part of
the Windows operating system -- it even handles drawing your user interface --
and an application running on that operating system.

.. rubric:: Linux pros

-   Linux is free
-   Linux is portable
-   Linux was made to keep on running
-   Linux is secure and versatile
-   Linux is scalable
-   The Linux OS and most Linux applications have very short debug-times

.. rubric:: Linux cons

-   There are far too many different distributions
-   Linux is not very friendly and confusing for beginners

.. rubric:: Linux -- the Kernel and distributions

The core of an operating system is the kernel.

At a low level, the "kernel" is the core computer program at the base of your
operating system. This single program is one of the first things loaded when
your operating system starts. It handles memory allocation, converts software
functions into instructions for your computer's CPU, and processes input and
output from hardware devices. The kernel typically runs in an isolated area
to prevent it from being used by other software on your computer.
The kernel of an operating system is crucial, but it's just one part of
the operating system.

Strictly speaking, the name **"Linux"** only applies to the operating system
kernel, which performs the actual operating system tasks. It takes care of
elementary functions like memory and process management and hardware control.
Application programs must call upon the kernel to, e.g. access files on disk.

However, Linux is still often referred to as an operating system.

To accomplish useful work, a multitude of system and application programs,
libraries, documentation etc. is necessary. "Distributions" are nothing but
up-to-date selections of these together with special programs (usually tools
for installation and maintenance) provided by companies or other organisations,
possibly together with other services such as support, documentation, or
updates. Distributions differ mostly in the selection of software they offer,
their administration tools, extra services, and price.
