Linux is a powerful, open-source operating system widely used in various
domains, from embedded systems to supercomputers. It is known for its
stability, security, and flexibility, making it a preferred choice for
developers, especially in server environments.

.. rubric:: Linux -- the Kernel and distributions

Strictly speaking, the name **"Linux"** only applies to the operating system
kernel, which performs the actual operating system tasks. It takes care of
elementary functions like memory and process management and hardware control.
Application programs must call upon the kernel to, e.g. access files on disk.

To accomplish useful work, a multitude of system and application programs,
libraries, documentation etc. is necessary. "Distributions" are nothing but
up-to-date selections of these together with special programs (usually tools
for installation and maintenance) provided by companies or other organisations,
possibly together with other services such as support, documentation, or
updates. Distributions differ mostly in the selection of software they offer,
their administration tools, extra services, and price.
