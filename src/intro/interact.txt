                      Interacting with Python Interpreter
*******************************************************************************

Itâ€™s time to write some Python code! :cite:`realpython:interact`

In short there are three major ways to do something with Python:

- interactive Python console
- running code from file [#]_
- use online editors (like `repl.it <https://repl.it>`_)

Using Python interpreter interactively
======================================

Using :abbr:`REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop)` environment is the most straight
forward way to start talking to Python. This simply means starting up the
interpreter and typing commands to it directly :cite:`realpython:interact`.
The interpreter:

- Reads the command you enter
- Evaluates and executes it
- Prints the output (if any) back to the console
- Loops back and repeats

Starting the interpreter
------------------------

In :abbr:`GUI (Graphic User Interface)` environment, it's likely that the
installer placed a shortcut on the desktop to launch the Python.

For example in Windows the interpreter can be found in the **Start** menu
labeled **Python 3.x**:

.. figure:: ../_static/img/start-menu-python.png
    :align: center

    Windows start menu Python group

.. hint:: In case you are getting error saying python is not installed, but you
          are sure that the interpreter **is installed** - this means you have
          no Python in your ``PATH``. Message may look like:
          ``'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command`` /
          ``python: command not found``

          Refer :doc:`/appx/env_path` for problem solution.

The alternative is to launch from a terminal window:

- **Command Prompt** in Windows
- **Terminal** both in macOS and Linux

.. figure:: ../_static/img/cmd-python.png
    :align: center

    Start Python via Command Prompt

.. figure:: ../_static/img/terminal-python.png
    :align: center

    Start Python via Terminal

Running code
------------

Put the Python code in interactive console and press enter to execute it.

#.  Ensure that the ``>>>`` prompt is displayed and the cursor is pointed after
    it
#.  Type the command ``print("Hello, World!")``
#.  Press enter

.. code-block:: python

    print(print("Hello, World!"))

If you see string "Hello, World!" printed back, congrats - you've run your
first program in Python.

Exiting the interpreter
-----------------------

To exit the interactive console type "exit" and hit enter.

.. code-block:: python

    exit()
