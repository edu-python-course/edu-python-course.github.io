                                Install Python
*******************************************************************************

The `official docs <https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download>`_
briefly describes the installation process.

Linux
=====

On most Linux distros Python comes pre-installed and/or all distro have it
available in their package repository (I haven't seen the one which does have).
The installation process depends on the distro, but here are some examples how
you can install it:

.. code-block::
    :caption: Install Python

    # Debian / Ubuntu (and other distros that uses ``apt``)
    apt install python3 python3-dev

    # ArchLinux
    pacman -S python3

    # RedHat, CentOS, Fedora
    dnf install python3 python3-devel

    # Gentoo
    # ... you should know what to do

MacOS
=====

For newer versions of MacOS Python is no longer included by default and you
will have to download and install it.

The `instructions <https://docs.python.org/3/using/mac.html>`_ in English.
Briefly, you are invited to visit https://python.org/ and download the latest
stable version of Python. A "universal binary" build of Python runs natively on
Mac's new Intel and legacy PPC CPUs.

After the installation you would get:

- `Python 3.x` folder in `Applications` folder.
  Standard development environment (`IDLE`) and `PythonLauncher` included.
- A framework `/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework` included libraries and
  executables.
