:abbr:`RDBMS (Relational Database Management System)` is a type of software
that helps users to create, update, manage, and access relational databases.
Relational databases organize data into tables, which consist of rows and
columns. Each column represents a specific attribute of the data, while each
row represents a specific instance of that data.

RDBMS allow users to interact with the database using
:abbr:`SQL (Structured Query Language)`, which is a standard language for
managing and manipulating relational databases. SQL allows users to perform
a variety of operations on the database, including adding, updating, and
deleting data, as well as retrieving data based on specific criteria.

RDBMS also provide a range of features to ensure data integrity, such as
enforcing data constraints, supporting transactions, and providing backup
and recovery capabilities. Additionally, RDBMS systems often provide tools
for managing the database, such as user interfaces for creating and modifying
tables and views, and monitoring tools for optimizing database performance.
