  The same information can be expressed on multiple rows, therefore updates to the relation may result in
  logical inconsistencies. If the <code>wheed1997</code> increase their <code>level</code>, when the
  <code>rank</code> should be updated as well. But if the update is only partial successful, then the
  relation is left in an inconsistent state. Specifically. the relation provides conflicting information
  on "level -- rank" for "wheed1997" player, and on "inventory" and "level" for "acen1999".
