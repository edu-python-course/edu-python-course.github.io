    Normalization is a process of organizing data in a database so that it is free from redundancy and dependency.
    It helps to eliminate data inconsistencies and anomalies, thereby improving data integrity. Normalization is a
    set of rules or guidelines to design a database schema in such a way that it avoids data duplication, data
    redundancy, and data inconsistency.
