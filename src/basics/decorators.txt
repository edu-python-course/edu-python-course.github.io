                                  Decorators
*******************************************************************************

Decorators provide a simple syntax for calling higher-order functions
:cite:`realpython:decorators`.

.. important::

    There is some kind of misunderstanding in definitions.

    **Decorator** is a function returning another function, usually applied
    as a function transformation using the ``@wrapper`` syntax
    :cite:`docs-python:term-decorator`.

    However, that's no quit enough to describe it. The more complete
    definition is:

    **Decorator** is a structural design pattern that lets you attach new
    behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper
    objects that contain the behaviors :cite:`refactoring.guru:decorator`.

Before you understand decorators, you must first understand how functions
work.

First-class objects
===================

In Python functions are `first-class objects`_. Everything in Python is an
object. Functions are objects too.

Inner functions
---------------

Functions can be nested. This means it is possible to define functions
inside other functions.

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: Nested functions example

    def heap_sort(origin: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        """Return a sorted collection using the heap sort algorithm"""

        def heapify(_ds: List[int], _size: int, _idx: int) -> List[int]:
            ...

        ...
        for idx in range(size, -1, -1):
            heapify(result, size, idx)
        ...

The order in which inner functions are defined no matters. The function
definition does not execute the function body; this gets executed only when
the function is called. Furthermore, the inner functions are not defined until
the parent function is called. They are locally scoped to their parent. Trying
to call ``heapify`` function outside of ``heap_sort`` will cause ``NameError``
exception.

Functions are objects
---------------------

This means functions can be passed around and used as arguments, just like any
other object (e.g. *int*, *str* etc.).

.. code-block:: python

    from typing import Callable


    def say_hello(name: str) -> str:
        return f"Hello, {name}!"


    def be_awesome(name: str) -> str:
        return f"Yo, {name}!"


    def greet_serhii(greeting_func: Callable) -> str:
        return greeting_func("Serhii")


    if __name__ == "__main__":
        print(f"{greet_serhii(say_hello) = }")
        print(f"{greet_serhii(be_awesome) = }")

Returning functions
-------------------

Since function can be passed as an argument, it may be returned from another
function.

.. code-block:: python

    from typing import Callable


    def parent(idx: int) -> Callable:
        def first_child():
            return "this is the first child"

        def second_child():
            return "this is the second child"

        return second if not num % 2 else first


    first = parent(1)
    second = parent(2)

.. note::

    ``parent`` returns functions themselves, there are no parentheses.

After running the code snippet above, ``first`` refers the ``first_child``
function from the inner ``parent`` scope. From now it can be used to call
the target function it refers.

.. code-block::

    >>> first()
    "this is the first child"
    >>> second()
    "this is the second child"

Simple decorators
=================

Now you're ready to move on and see the magical beast that is the Python
decorators. Let's start with a simple example:

.. code-block:: python

    def decorator(func: Callable) -> Callable:
        def wrapper():
            print(f"before {func.__name__} call")
            func()
            print(f"after {func.__name__} call")

        return wrapper  # no wrapper call, return reference to wrapper function

    def say_hello():
        print("Hello!")

    say_hello_decorated = decorator(say_hello)

Running function:

.. code-block::

    >>> say_hello()
    Hello!
    >>> say_hello_decorated()
    before say_hello call
    Hello!
    after say_hello call

The common way to use decorators is to replace the original function with
a decorated one:

.. code-block::

    >>> say_hello = decorator(say_hello)
    >>> say_hello()
    before say_hello call
    Hello!
    after say_hello call

``say_hello`` function is the reference to the ``decorator.<locals>.wrapper``,
which itself is bound to the original ``say_hello`` function. There is a
syntactic sugar to do this, called *pie-syntax*. The following example does
exact the same things as the first decorator example:

.. code-block:: python

    def decorator(func: Callable) -> Callable:
        def wrapper():
            print(f"before {func.__name__} call")
            func()
            print(f"after {func.__name__} call")

        return wrapper  # no wrapper call, return reference to wrapper function


    @decorator
    def say_hello():
        print("Hello!")

.. important::

    There is no way to *undecorate* object in Python. Once something is bound
    to the decorator's wrapper - it is decorated forever.

A decorated function still remains a **function**. So, it can be decorated
once more time again, and again, and again...

.. code-block:: python

    from typing import Callable


    def bread(func: Callable) -> Callable:
        def wrapper():
            print("<--bread-->")
            func()
            print("<--bread-->")

        return wrapper


    def vegetables(func: Callable) -> Callable:
        def wrapper():
            print("~~~salad~~~")
            print("***tomato***")
            func()

        return wrapper


    def cheese(func: Callable) -> Callable:
        def wrapper():
            func()
            print("---cheese---")

        return wrapper


    @bread
    @vegetables
    @cheese
    def sandwich():
        print("_sliced_meat_")

.. code-block::

    >>> sandwich()
    <--bread-->
    ~~~salad~~~
    ***tomato***
    _sliced_meat_
    ---cheese---
    <--bread-->

.. note::

    "Wrapper" is the alternative nickname for the Decorator pattern that
    clearly expresses the main idea of the pattern. A wrapper is an object that
    can be linked with some target object. The wrapper contains the same set of
    methods as the target and delegates to it all requests it receives.
    However, the wrapper may alter the result by doing something either before
    or after it passes the request to the target.

Passing arguments to the wrapper
================================

Until now the examples use *simple* decorators. But what if the decorated
function gets some arguments? This will cause ``TypeError`` exception that tell
that "arguments are missed". This can be fixed with just passing arguments to
the ``wrapper`` inner function.

.. code-block:: python

    import logging
    from typing import Callable

    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
    logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)


    def log(func: Callable) -> Callable:
        def wrapper(x, y):
            logger.info("%s called", func.__name__)
            return func(x, y)

        return wrapper


    @log
    def sum_numbers(x, y):
        return x + y

If case you're trying to make a generic decorator, you may pass ``*args`` and
``**kwargs`` instead of exact arguments:

.. code-block:: python

    from typing import Callable


    def generic_decorator(func: Callable) -> Callable:
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            ...  # do something before
            result = func(*args, **kwargs)
            ...  # do something after

            return result

        return wrapper

Passing arguments to decorator
==============================

At last it's time to know how to pass arguments to the decorator.
Here is a simple implementation of ``defer`` decorator which deferred
the function execution for some time:

.. code-block:: python

    import time
    from typing import Callable


    def defer(seconds: int = 3) -> Callable:
        def decorator(func: Callable) -> Callable:
            def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
                started_at = time.perf_counter()
                time.sleep(seconds)
                result = func(*args, **kwargs)
                completed_in = round(time.perf_counter() - started_at, 2)
                print("Completed in %.2f" % completed_in)

                return result

            return wrapper

        return decorator


    @defer()
    def function_a():
        return 42


    @defer(10)
    def function_b():
        return 24


.. code-block::

    function_a()
    Completed in 3.00
    function_b()
    Completed in 10.00
